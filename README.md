# network-ripe-analysis


This project analyzed network data from RIPE Atlas, specifically related to IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity for 3 services: Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.
It measured 30 probes for every country of the image below, over the course of 24 hours with 1 hour intervals, using Traceroute.

The results demonstrated in the .ipynb showed better performance for IPV4, and a possible slight advantadge in success-rate responses for IPV6, although not signficantly more. 
According to the correlation heatmap the results of latency were mainly influenced by number of jumps (with a +0.4 correlation), and not much else had greater significance.
